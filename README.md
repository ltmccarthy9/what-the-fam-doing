# What The Fam Doing?

## Description
We're all aware that our parents and grandparents have 
invaded facebook and instagram.  Soon, all of the apps will fall, and we'll all be scratching
our heads wondering how we let this happen. Unless...We can stop that from ever happening in the first place.

This is a new social media application that I'm working on that is specifically made
for families to stay connected.  
This app will allow you to stay in contact with everyone including grandma and grandpa without
any controversial articles, videos, and bots being shoved down everyone's throat.  Each family will have their own group, where you can create your own subgroups that are completely open to everyone in the
whole family.
